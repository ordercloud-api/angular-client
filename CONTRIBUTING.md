# Contributing to @ordercloud/angular-sdk

Hello! Thanks for your interest in contributing! Before implementing new features and changes please create an issue so we can have a discussion about it!

## ‚å® Writing code

Unlike other libraries, most of the code here is not handwritten. We use [@ordercloud/oc-codegen](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/oc-codegen) to generate the code based on a set of templates located in `/codegen/`. This tool uses OrderCloud's OpenAPI specification along with the templates to generate the full SDK. That means most of your time should be spent in the `/codegen/` folder. Any direct changes in `projects/sdk/src/` will simply be overwritten when you run `npm run build`.

## Template Data

The source of the data comes from the open api spec but then the oc-codegen library massages the data to make it easier to work with. That library exposes "hooks" which allow us to step in and do our own processing during that data massage layer. In our case we add javascript and typescript specific properties that allow us to build a rich SDK. All of our hooks are available in a single file [projects/sdk/codegen/hooks.ts](./projects/sdk/codegen/hooks.ts)

To view the template data simply run the following command which will output the data to `templateData.json` at the root of the project.

```shell
npm run debug-template-data
```

## Generating the SDK

After updating the templates/hooks you can generate the code which will be output in the `src/` directory

```shell
npm run codegen
```

## ‚ú® Submitting a pull request

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch with the name of the feature you plan to work on
3. Install dependencies
4. Make your changes. Note: all of your changes should be to files in `/codegen` and not directly to any of the files in `projects/sdk/src/lib` as those files get overwritten when the code is generated.
5. Run `npm run build` to generate the sdk, compile the code, run the tests, and generate the docs
6. Verify your changes work as expected. Run `npm install /path/to/this/folder` in a different project to install locally and test
7. Update the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
8. Commit your changes. We adhere to the [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) standard
9. Verify the version has been bumped and adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
    - Version should be updated in both package.json and projects/sdk/package.json.
    - Version update should be its own commit
    - Use following format for the commmit: `:bookmark: {VERSION}`
10. Create a pull request
11. Have a beer! üç∫

## üöÄ Releasing
